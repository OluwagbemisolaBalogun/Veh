Veh-Regression: Machine Learning on sales is a regression project kernel which focuses on Data understanding, Data exploration and preparation, Data cleaning and preparation and Models building and evaluation.

VehicleTrader-Dataset is a great dataset to apply domain knowledge for feature engineering, so I made a research and learned a lot about the AutoTrader company. I was able to access the UK website (https://www.autotrader.co.uk/) and discovered they deal in a variety of vehicles from new to old, and even exotic to regular, they are also into body types ranging between Cars, Luxury cars, Vans, Bikes, Motorhomes, Caravans and Trucks.

With over 430k vehicles on the UK version I tried to find out some of those links between the columns and factors that had pricing of vehicles, also discovering that individuals are also allowed to post their listings on the platform.

Model selection and tuning
Each algorithm has different strengths and weaknesses, and so we need to select the algorithm that works best with our specific data. We will use the Scikit-learn library to compare the performance of the following algorithms:

- LinearRegression - Linear regression
- RandomForestRegressor - Random Forest Regressor.
- Ridge Regressor - Ridge Regressor
- Lasso Regressor - Lasso Regressor
